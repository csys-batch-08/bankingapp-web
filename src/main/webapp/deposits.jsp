   <h2 align="center"> Fixed Deposits (FDs): How they work</h2><br><br>
   <p>Fixed Deposits have been a tried-and-tested savings method for a long time. Almost all banks in India have Fixed Deposits schemes available for their customers. You can read more about the rules and processes of obtaining FDs here. While FDs have been the conventional investment tools, you need to keep some things in mind before going for one:</p><br>
   <br>

  <h3>Spread your investments</h3><br><br>
<p>If you want to invest in an FD, do not park all your investments in a single bank. You need to know that bank FDs aren't as secure as you think. In case of bank default, you will be eligible for a maximum compensation of Rs 5 lakh from Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) with effect from 4 February 2020.  This happens even though you held deposits of amount higher than Rs 1 lakh. If you have Rs 5 Lakh to invest, then hold FDs of Rs 1 lakh in five banks rather than Rs 5 lakh in a single bank.</p><br>
<br>
<h3>Premature withdrawals attracts penalty</h3><br><br>
<p>You need to know that FD involves a lock-in period equal to duration of the investment. Before going for an FD, review your income needs for the horizon. If you institute an FD for a 5-year term, then the bank won't allow for withdrawals before completion of 5 years. In case you need your money before maturity, bank will impose a penalty. If the penalty is 1%, then you may lose more than you earned during the tenure. Thus, it's advisable not to break your FDs before maturity.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Interest earned is clubbed in your income</h3><br><br>
<p>FDs aren't as tax-efficient as mutual funds and equities. The interest earned on FDs will be clubbed in your total income and taxed as per your income slab. Suppose you create an FD in the name of your spouse. The money deployed to create FD won't attract tax but the interest earned will form part of your income and be taxed. Equity-Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) can be a tax-efficient way to invest and grow wealth. It has the shortest lock-in period. Moreover, it offers higher returns than FD.</p>
<br><br>
<h2 align="center">Recurring Deposits (RDs): Are they for you?</h2><br><br>
<p>RD or Recurring Deposits are an investment tool which allows investors to make regular monthly payments and save money for the long term. Investors can choose the tenure of the deposit and the minimum monthly payment they wish to make according to their convenience. RD schemes are generally more flexible than FD schemes and are generally preferred by those who want to start an account for the purpose of saving money and building a rainy-day fund. Here are some things you should keep in mind while opting for a Recurring Deposit:</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Use RDs for short-term goals</h3><br><br>
<p>Recurring deposits are the ideal products to opt for when planning short-term goals you wish to realize in the next 1-3 yrs. These may include saving up for a downpayment of your new home, paying for your children's education, renovating your home, saving up for a degree abroad and so on.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Be aware of the rules and penalties</h3><br><br>
<p>Recurring deposits are very easy to open. Most banks in the country have this facility. But, they do come with some hidden charges. For instance, if you were to withdraw the amount in the RD account before the tenure finishes, you may have to pay certain charges. It is important to know these rules before you start an RD account so you can be better prepared for the future. Apart from these, there are other types of accounts in which you can deposit your money:</p>
